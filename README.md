### Description

This code provides an alternative Messagebox with just 3 additional files to your project. 1 form, 1 module and 1 user control (chameleonButton Button by Conchuki). A complete designer has been included in the demo project which allows GUI design of msgboxes. Different icons, scroll bar, XP/2000 style etc. This was submitted a while ago as a bog standard msgbox by someone but I cannot find out who. Ive included the original.

Please vote if you like it, if you don't, tell me why you don't so I can improve it.

Enjoy!
